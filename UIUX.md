I tried to make the Ui forgiving by allowing the user to get to where they need with a few clicks. there are many forms which the user can easily close and open without running into accessibility issues. I also tried to ensure that componenets were consistent, which was easy using the MUI library due to its inherent visual characteristics. Additionally, everything is labeled with names that clearly reflect the purpose and function of the component being accessed.
