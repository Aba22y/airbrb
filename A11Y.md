I've provided various close buttons in case a user changes their mind after opening a form. For instance, the filter menu used in the landign page features this. When a listing owner opens up the booking menu for a particular listing, buttons are disabled if a bookings status is no longer pending indicating that a decision has already been made. I have also tried to keep the number of clicks to a minimum, allowing users to take advantage of a variety of functions on a single page. An example of this is the owned listings page, which features a number of buttons for each of the displayed listings.
